Java - Cloud Services - Intro into Cloud

1. Calculate costs difference between on-premises one server vs cloud solutions (IaaS - infrastructure as a service).

Take into consideration things like: 
- costs of hardware
- power consumption
- space

Asumme:
- price per kWh as 11 cents
- space cost as $100 per square meter

2. Name pros and cons for using cloud vs on-premises.
